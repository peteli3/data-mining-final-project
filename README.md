# Correlating athlete value with statistics: a NBA case study

Final Project for:
ORIE 4740 - Statistical Data Mining
Spring 2018, taught by Yudong Chen

## Abstract
Among the most lucrative of modern-day entertainment businesses, the NBA has grown into an entity worth over $30 billion, signing individual athletes to contracts worth as much as $20 million a year. As a study, we will explore the implications of performance statics on how NBA franchises value athletes. Our goal in this project is to apply data mining techniques to historical NBA data to predict a player's projected next-step valuation and identify the most critical performance stats (predictors) in doing so.
